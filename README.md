# Hello friend.

<p align="center">
👋 Hey there

I’m François, a French full-stack developer currently exploring the world — one project and one country at a time. 🌍
With seven years of experience in web development, I specialize in building clean, efficient, and meaningful digital products that connect design and technology.

Graduated from Université Paris-Descartes, I bring together technical rigor and artistic sensibility.
I love turning ideas into elegant code, simplifying complexity, and making technology feel effortless for users.

In every team, I act as a bridge between developers, designers, and product minds — ensuring clear communication, solid architecture, and a seamless experience from prototype to production.
